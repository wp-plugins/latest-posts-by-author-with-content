== Description ==

This Plugin is extended version of "Latest Posts by Author" Wordpress plugin. This plugin allows you to display an unordered list of links to a specific author's latest posts (or a list of multiple authors). It can be called either with a shortcode or from within a theme file.

To call it with a shortcode, use `[latestbyauthor author="username" show="3"]` where "username" is the login name of the author (or a comma separated list of multiple authors) and "3" is the number of posts to display. If you don't specify an author or a display number, it will show the latest 5 posts from the author of the current page. If you want it to display the post excerpt as well, you can use the following code: `[latestbyauthor author="username" show="3" excerpt="true"]` This will only show exerpts that you have entered manually.

To call it from within a theme template, you have to wrap it in this PHP function: `<?php echo do_shortcode('[latestbyauthor author="username" show="3"]'); ?>`
